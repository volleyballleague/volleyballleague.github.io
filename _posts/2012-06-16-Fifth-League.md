Dear friends, we have collectively raised a total of **$3864.79 ($2958.63 + $906.16)** through tournament fees (two tournaments), individual donations and sponsorship (not many unfortunately). A total of **₹2,20,000** is spent towards the below two needs of the farmers. Even though we spent ₹ 2,20,000, our raised money across both the 2012 leagues summed up to only 2,09,896.75 (exchange rate of ₹ 54.31). But we spent more as the need was like that and the committee was pretty sure about raising the difference ₹ 10,103.25 in 2013.

The list below provides more specifics (like money lost etc.) on these unfortunate deaths. According to the G.O # 421, the family of the deceased should be rendered an amount of Rs 1.5 lakhs as an assistance and rehabilitation of bereaved family members.

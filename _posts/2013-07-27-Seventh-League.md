| Where will be my money spent?	| GGH (Government General Hospital) was established as a District Head quarters Hospital in 1848 in a rented tiled house over the Madras Trunk Road. It grew in stages, changed locations and in 1954 it was upgraded to a Teaching Hospital and named Govt. Gen. Hospital, Guntur. The pediatrics division could use some help in the form of medicines and other related supplies for the needy who can't afford to purchase some of them. There are an average of 90 infant deaths in this division according to the research of a state wide news paper (Click here to read the article in Telugu). Sri Bala Bharathi has been helping as much as possible in this regard with the support from local patrons for quite sometime. This year's raised money will be spent to support this cause. |

Dear friends, we have collectively raised a total of **$3864.79 ($2958.63 + $906.16)** through tournament fees (two tournaments), individual donations and sponsorship (not many unfortunately). A total of **₹2,20,000** is spent towards the below two needs of the farmers. Even though we spent ₹ 2,20,000, our raised money across both the 2012 leagues summed up to only 2,09,896.75 (exchange rate of ₹ 54.31). But we spent more as the need was like that and the committee was pretty sure about raising the difference ₹ 10,103.25 in 2013.
